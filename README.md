This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries: using aggregate functions like AVG() incorrectly within the WHERE clause. The provided SQL query attempts to filter employees based on whether their salary exceeds the average salary. However, the AVG(salary) function is not correctly used in this context and leads to an error. The solution provides a corrected version that first calculates the average salary in a subquery and then uses it for comparison.
